When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Whenever there is need to access the work files remotely.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Two people might be working on the same part of the project, and one
    uploads before the other one. If this causes the other guys files to change,
    it's a problem. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: When I don't have the permission to change the original, but I want
    to change/work on the original.
    Clone: When I'm working on a project for updating it, and the project is
    on github with the permission to change is given to me.
    Branches: When the main version of a project should be working well at all
    times, but I still want to experiment on it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The biggest benefit is that it allows the user to make changes offline, and
    keep track of the point of time where the user's version differed from the
    original file.
